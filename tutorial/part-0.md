# Part 0 - Setting Up

## Prior Knowledge
This tutorial will attempt to be beginner friendly, but some experience with
programming will help.  For the sake of simplicity, I will be using DragonRuby 
on Windows 10, but DragonRuby Game Toolkit is highly portable and the same 
instructions should run on multiple operating systems. 

## Project Setup
### Download DragonRuby
You will need a copy of DragonRuby Game Toolkit for th is tutorial.  
You can acquire it from either of these sites.  You may even already 
own a copy if you back lots of bundles on Itch.io. 

* http://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game
* https://dragonruby.itch.io/

### Creating the game
Unzip your new copy of DragonRuby, and name the folder something like `DR_Snake_Tutorial`

### Using DragonRuby Game Toolkit
Open your game folder, and double-click on `dragonruby.exe` to run the game engine.

You will probably receive a Windows Protection popup like this one:
![Windows Protection Dialog](../tutorial/Windows_Protect_1.png?raw=true "Windows Protection Dialog")

Click on the `More Info` link to expand to the following
![Windows Protection More Info](../tutorial/Windows_Protect_2.png?raw=true "Windows Protection More Info")

Verify the app is "dragonruby.exe" and click `Run Anyway` to actually run DR.
